            <p>Hey, my name is Joaquin and I am a first year GDD major. I like videogames (who could have guessed) and anime and have recently been getting into world building.
                i hope to be able to get into the video game industry and even start my own game studio. As for this class i hope to learn enoguh about web programing to be able to make
                web games and have a enough knowledge to start looking into server based multiplayer games.
            </p>
